  <p id="intro">A day-to-day journal from Seattle during the Coronavirus outbreak.</p>

  <h2>March</h2>

  <h3>4 | Wednesday</h3>

  <p>
    I haven’t added to this journal in several months, but today I was inspired to do so by all the recent events relating to the Coronavirus. A few months ago news of the virus came out of Wuhan, China, and since then containment of it has seemed to continually evade the grasp of all efforts. Currently there are nearly 100,000 cases around the world, the vast majority in China. Over 3,000 have died, making it a 3% fatality rate, though this is very uncertain in these early stages. Fortunately, over half of confirmed cases have made a recovery, including all 16 patients thus far identified in Vietnam.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, Washington State has been the most active place in the US for the virus, where there have been 40 confirmed cases and 10 deaths. A coworker of mine, found out just yesterday that her mother-in-law might have been exposed. We’ve all been washing our hands and using hand sanitizer constantly, as well as avoiding physical contact and touching our faces. Our boss is looking into ways to move our work to the web, though unfortunately it looks like I won’t be able to work from home, and will still be taking public transport.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because of this I don’t know if I’ll be able to go to my friend's wedding, scheduled for April. I went to QFC today to stock up on food, and the entire hand sanitizer section was cleared out. Masks are almost impossible to come buy. It’s frightening, but at the same time oddly exciting. I feel like I’m playing a game where I’m avoiding the virus in increasingly novel ways. Hopefully that feeling won’t be superseded by the terrifying nature of all that’s going on. One epidemiologist estimated that between 20 and 80 percent of all adults will get the virus in the long run. I hope to avoid that.
  </p>

  <h3>5 | Thursday</h3>

  <p>
    There are now 70 confirmed cases in Washington. The county has recommended that all 2 million residents work from home if able, but unfortunately that includes hardly anyone. My friends at Amazon and Microsoft can, but I certainly can’t. I feel like a failure. I hate being so cornered in to things because of this job, but I’ve put no effort into changing that. I’ve spent hundreds of hours learning German, which is a skill I really want and something that certainly excites me, but I know part of it is to give myself an excuse to avoid doing what I really need to do when it comes to my wellbeing. It’s probably inevitable that I catch this, and with my asthmatic lungs I’m not sure how I’ll cope. I’m kinda scared.
  </p>

  <h3>6 | Friday</h3>

  <p>
    The novelty has quickly worn off. I'm quite concerned. There are now over 100,000 cases worldwide, and over 80 in Washington. A friend got me a mask and a bottle of hand sanitizer. Another even offered to spot me rent, which is incredibly generous of them. I of course hope to avoid making use of such an offer, but it's nice to have regardless. Hardships bring out the best in people (even Kim Jong Un expressed sorrow for South Korea).
  </p>

  <p>
    I went to Safeway to get more food, mostly soup cans, and I saw that they were restricting the sale of water. I sincerely hope it doesn't get so bad that we lack tap water.
  </p>

  <p>
    Around 7pm I received an email from work saying they are in fact aiming to do remote work, which is such a relief.
  </p>

  <h3>7 | Saturday</h3>

  <p>
    There are now over 100 confirmed cases in Washington, and the virus is considered endemic to Seattle. Every pain I feel causes me worry. There are many reports of easy recovery, but there are also many reports of people falling sick again after having “recovered”. I spoke with a friend and she says her sister is taking three showers a day as a precaution. That’s likely overkill, especially as she isn’t leaving the house, but at the same time it’s understandable.
  </p>

  <h3>8 | Sunday</h3>

  <p>
    There are over 120 cases in Washington, 18 of whom have died. I got a haircut and was trying to use less common streets, yet still constantly ran into people. No one seems worried, though I guess all the worried people would be home. While on my way someone cleared their throat and I startled, thinking it was a cough. I don’t know how paranoid I’m being.
  </p>

  <p>
    I went to QFC as well, and it was packed. The entire time I was there I was stressed. I’m gonna start using Amazon Fresh, though I can't be sure that such a service will be available for too much longer.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few hours after writing that there have been 120 cases and 18 deaths in Washington, those numbers increased to 136 cases and 19 deaths. Italy has quarantined a fourth of its population after reporting that there are over 7000 cases there.
  </p>

  <h3>9 | Monday</h3>

  <p>
    Took an hour long nap and had an hour of nightmares. Gotta find a way to relieve the stress.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even at 10 at night the bus is still crowded. It feels impossible to stay isolated. Italy has now quarantined its entire population, and there are over 4000 deaths worldwide. We're supposed to be able to do remote work once the schools close, but they seem so reticent to do so, announcing openly, as an advertisement of their stupidity, that they will only close once a case is found. It sounds horrible but I hope they find a case soon. The identification of a case can only follow many infections.
  </p>

  <p>
    The total dead for Washington stands at 23 now, with over 160 confirmed cases. I tried to buy a bunch of canned goods from Amazon Fresh but they didn't have any available times that I could use. I guess others are also using them.
  </p>

  <h3>10 | Tuesday</h3>

  <p>
    Had my first online class. They’re hoping to get all classes online by the end of the week, so we can work remotely next week. There are now over 250 confirmed cases in Washington and 24 dead. I really hope the number of cases don’t explode this week and that I can get through it. I ordered a bunch of canned food to come on Thursday. Once I can work from home I don’t plan on leaving my apartment for a long time.
  </p>

  <h3>11 | Wednesday</h3>

  <p>
    Had another online class. Tomorrow is going to be dedicated to training for online classes and preparation for them, and will hopefully be the last day I have to go out. There are now over 360 confirmed cases in Washington. Italy has suspended all non-essential businesses and outlawed standing too close to others. I texted my mother and many friends asking if they were preparing; one in particular did not know the situation in Italy. I’m getting my delivery of canned food tomorrow, as well as a box of nitrile gloves. When I get back from work I’ll hopefully be able to quarantine myself.

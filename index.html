  <h1>Life in Seattle</h1>

  <p id="intro">A day-to-day journal from Seattle during the Coronavirus outbreak.</p>

  <h2>March</h2>

  <h3>4 | Wednesday</h3>

  <p>
    I haven’t added to this journal in several months, but today I was inspired to do so by all the recent events relating to the Coronavirus. A few months ago news of the virus came out of Wuhan, China, and since then containment of it has seemed to continually evade the grasp of all efforts. Currently there are nearly 100,000 cases around the world, the vast majority in China. Over 3,000 have died, making it a 3% fatality rate, though this is very uncertain in these early stages. Fortunately, over half of confirmed cases have made a recovery, including all 16 patients thus far identified in Vietnam.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, Washington State has been the most active place in the US for the virus, where there have been 40 confirmed cases and 10 deaths. A coworker of mine, found out just yesterday that her mother-in-law might have been exposed. We’ve all been washing our hands and using hand sanitizer constantly, as well as avoiding physical contact and touching our faces. Our boss is looking into ways to move our work to the web, though unfortunately it looks like I won’t be able to work from home, and will still be taking public transport.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because of this I don’t know if I’ll be able to go to my friend's wedding, scheduled for April. I went to QFC today to stock up on food, and the entire hand sanitizer section was cleared out. Masks are almost impossible to come buy. It’s frightening, but at the same time oddly exciting. I feel like I’m playing a game where I’m avoiding the virus in increasingly novel ways. Hopefully that feeling won’t be superseded by the terrifying nature of all that’s going on. One epidemiologist estimated that between 20 and 80 percent of all adults will get the virus in the long run. I hope to avoid that.
  </p>

  <h3>5 | Thursday</h3>

  <p>
    There are now 70 confirmed cases in Washington. The county has recommended that all 2 million residents work from home if able, but unfortunately that includes hardly anyone. My friends at Amazon and Microsoft can, but I certainly can’t. I feel like a failure. I hate being so cornered in to things because of this job, but I’ve put no effort into changing that. I’ve spent hundreds of hours learning German, which is a skill I really want and something that certainly excites me, but I know part of it is to give myself an excuse to avoid doing what I really need to do when it comes to my wellbeing. It’s probably inevitable that I catch this, and with my asthmatic lungs I’m not sure how I’ll cope. I’m kinda scared.
  </p>

  <h3>6 | Friday</h3>

  <p>
    The novelty has quickly worn off. I'm quite concerned. There are now over 100,000 cases worldwide, and over 80 in Washington. A friend got me a mask and a bottle of hand sanitizer. Another even offered to spot me rent, which is incredibly generous of them. I of course hope to avoid making use of such an offer, but it's nice to have regardless. Hardships bring out the best in people (even Kim Jong Un expressed sorrow for South Korea).
  </p>

  <p>
    I went to Safeway to get more food, mostly soup cans, and I saw that they were restricting the sale of water. I sincerely hope it doesn't get so bad that we lack tap water.
  </p>

  <p>
    Around 7pm I received an email from work saying they are in fact aiming to do remote work, which is such a relief.
  </p>

  <h3>7 | Saturday</h3>

  <p>
    There are now over 100 confirmed cases in Washington, and the virus is considered endemic to Seattle. Every pain I feel causes me worry. There are many reports of easy recovery, but there are also many reports of people falling sick again after having “recovered”. I spoke with a friend and she says her sister is taking three showers a day as a precaution. That’s likely overkill, especially as she isn’t leaving the house, but at the same time it’s understandable.
  </p>

  <h3>8 | Sunday</h3>

  <p>
    There are over 120 cases in Washington, 18 of whom have died. I got a haircut and was trying to use less common streets, yet still constantly ran into people. No one seems worried, though I guess all the worried people would be home. While on my way someone cleared their throat and I startled, thinking it was a cough. I don’t know how paranoid I’m being.
  </p>

  <p>
    I went to QFC as well, and it was packed. The entire time I was there I was stressed. I’m gonna start using Amazon Fresh, though I can't be sure that such a service will be available for too much longer.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few hours after writing that there have been 120 cases and 18 deaths in Washington, those numbers increased to 136 cases and 19 deaths. Italy has quarantined a fourth of its population after reporting that there are over 7000 cases there.
  </p>

  <h3>9 | Monday</h3>

  <p>
    Took an hour long nap and had an hour of nightmares. Gotta find a way to relieve the stress.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even at 10 at night the bus is still crowded. It feels impossible to stay isolated. Italy has now quarantined its entire population, and there are over 4000 deaths worldwide. We're supposed to be able to do remote work once the schools close, but they seem so reticent to do so, announcing openly, as an advertisement of their stupidity, that they will only close once a case is found. It sounds horrible but I hope they find a case soon. The identification of a case can only follow many infections.
  </p>

  <p>
    The total dead for Washington stands at 23 now, with over 160 confirmed cases. I tried to buy a bunch of canned goods from Amazon Fresh but they didn't have any available times that I could use. I guess others are also using them.
  </p>

  <h3>10 | Tuesday</h3>

  <p>
    Had my first online class. They’re hoping to get all classes online by the end of the week, so we can work remotely next week. There are now over 250 confirmed cases in Washington and 24 dead. I really hope the number of cases don’t explode this week and that I can get through it. I ordered a bunch of canned food to come on Thursday. Once I can work from home I don’t plan on leaving my apartment for a long time.
  </p>

  <h3>11 | Wednesday</h3>

  <p>
    Had another online class. Tomorrow is going to be dedicated to training for online classes and preparation for them, and will hopefully be the last day I have to go out. There are now over 360 confirmed cases in Washington. Italy has suspended all non-essential businesses and outlawed standing too close to others. I texted my mother and many friends asking if they were preparing; one in particular did not know the situation in Italy. I’m getting my delivery of canned food tomorrow, as well as a box of nitrile gloves. When I get back from work I’ll hopefully be able to quarantine myself.
  </p>

  <h3>12 | Thursday</h3>

  <p>
    Went in to work for the last time. From here on out it’s working from home. I feel like a weight has been lifted. Got a Lyft there and back, and even at rush hour there was no traffic. Schools around Seattle have been closed till April 24th, as have all public libraries, as there are now over 450 confirmed cases in Washington, with 31 deaths. Nearly every sporting event has been cancelled. Tons of restaurants and small businesses are closing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The day to day lives of so many people are changing overnight, with no end in sight. I can’t see how this can get any better any time soon. Some of my friends don’t think it’s an issue, and I’m sure it won’t be much of a health issue for them, but even so their lives will surely be affected regardless of whether or not their bodies will.
  </p>

  <h3>13 | Friday</h3>

  <p>
    National emergency has been declared by President Trump. Governor Inslee of Washington has banned all gatherings of more than 250 people. There are over 140,000 confirmed cases around the world and nearly 5800 deaths. In Washington there are 568 cases and 37 deaths. I’m incredibly grateful to be able to quarantine, and so sorry for all those whose lives are more affected. I worry about my mom. She says she’s prepared, but she’s not in the best financial position, and she’s in an at-risk demographic.
  </p>

  <p>
    I think I need to stop looking at the news, as it causes me untold stress. I have such difficulty falling asleep nowadays, and I seek out this information, which I know will upset me, almost compulsively, which distracts from the things that actually bring me joy.
  </p>

  <h3>15 | Sunday</h3>

  <p>
    The past couple days have been very relaxed. I wake up whenever, do whatever I want all day, and then sleep. It’s a bit lonely, but playing videogames with friends mostly alleviates that. One terribly upsetting thing, however, is that one of the soups on which I stocked up turned out to be disgusting. Oh well.
  </p>

  <p>
    In real news, restaurants will no longer be able to have dine-in services in Washington State for the foreseeable future, and meetings of over 50 people are prohibited. There are over 769 confirmed cases and 42 deaths. My initially stubborn friend finally stocked up a bit following advice to do so from his father. It’s getting rather serious. I had hopes of finding a new job soon, but it looks like that’s gone out the window; I’m just fortunate that my current job doesn’t appear at risk.
  </p>

  <h3>16 | Monday</h3>

  <p>
    My friend in the Bay Area says that they are in lockdown, Italian style. Here in Seattle public transport and freeways are soon going to be closed, a lockdown order probably imminent as well. I’m certainly locked down. Amazon Fresh has no available delivery times, which is a shame, ‘cause I’m running out of sandwich stuff and I’ve been craving Oreos. If they’re unavailable now I can’t imagine they’ll be available any time in the near future, so it looks like It’s pretty much all canned food from here on out.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today marked one of the largest drops of the stock market in history, as did a few days ago, and a few days before that. The economy seems to be collapsing. I have hardly any savings and don’t make very much, but as long as I don’t get laid off I should be fine. Here’s hoping...
  </p>

  <h3>17 | Tuesday</h3>

  <p>
    Had my first class from home, which went quite well, but it looks like I’ll have to come in tomorrow for work. I basically have to take a Lyft, but that’s quite a bit of money right when money is really tight. Fortunately the IRS has delayed the due date for taxes by three months, which makes things a lot easier, at least for now.
  </p>

  <h3>19 | Thursday</h3>

  <p>
    There are now well over 1300 cases in Washington and over 70 deaths. 10,000 deaths worldwide. I got an Amazon Fresh order, which is the last physical contact with the outside world I’m planning to have for a while. About an hour ago the entire state of California went into lockdown.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every day seems like a sudden change from the last; no one knows where things are going, but we all know it’s somewhere of which we want to know nothing.
  </p>

  <h3>20 | Friday</h3>

  <p>
    A friend of mine in Woodinville put on her snapchat story a video of her in line at Costco, a line that stretched all the way around the store. It seems that nowhere is escaping this. Eleven thousand have died around the world so far, most of those being in Italy and China, but around 240 being in the US. In the coming months who knows how many more will pass.
  </p>

  <h3>21 | Saturday</h3>

  <p>
    Had a relaxed day. There are all sorts of posts online about how the number of cases in the US and UK are following the same pattern as Italy. My aunt and grandma in rural Oregon are having trouble finding toilet paper and, more importantly, insulin, but fortunately they’re well-stocked on both. Not much is new today, just the same old continuous deterioration of the world that we’ve been accustomed to for the past week (it seems so much longer than that).
  </p>

  <h3>23 | Monday</h3>

  <p>
    The governor of Washington finally put the state into lockdown. I was wondering when it would happen; there are now over 100 deaths and 2000 confirmed cases here. New York (the city) has more cases than all of South Korea, with over 23,000 cases.
  </p>

  <h3>26 | Thursday</h3>

  <p>
    With over 16,000 new cases just today, America has now become the country with the most Coronavirus cases, surpassing China. I doubt that is actually true, given China’s famous lack of transparency, but the fact that we’re nearing 100,000 (and at this rate will reach it tomorrow) is terribly worrying. The federal government is planning on giving every American $1,200, which would be very helpful.
  </p>

  <h3>28 | Saturday</h3>

  <p>
    There are now over 120,000 confirmed cases in America, and nearly 2,000 deaths.
  </p>

  <h3>31 | Tuesday</h3>

  <p>
    I went to the grocery store today and could not avoid noticing a marked change in countenance in everyone around. People are avoiding each other, as they should, but it's not out of fear. People don't look scared, they just seem to understand. It's a rather surreal experience knowing that you share an understanding with each and every stranger you come across, as each and every person has had their lives affected by this.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stores themselves are still rather crowded. Generally people try to keep their distance, but ultimately they're concerned about getting what they need and going.
  </p>

  <h2>April</h2>

  <h3>2 | Thursday</h3>

  <p>
    Worldwide cases exceeded one million today.
  </p>

  <h3>3 | Friday</h3>

  <p>
    The government has just put out an advisory to wear face coverings, reversing previous policy. I went to the grocery store today, and that advice was certainly heeded. Previously I would only see two or three people wearing masks, all of whom would be Asian, but now it’s dozens of people, and of all races.
  </p>

  <p>
    America has somewhere around 277,000 confirmed cases now, 100,000 of which are in New York. The news reports of hospitals there are terrifying. Hopefully the distancing policies put in place here will prevent it from getting like that, but I’m not very hopeful. It seems inevitable. There are now nearly 60,000 dead worldwide from the virus, 7,400 of whom were in America.
  </p>

  <p>
    I took a walk around the streets near my apartment at 1am, a time at which those streets would normally be quite alive on a Friday night, but they were completely dead. The few people I did see were homeless. Just about every business had a sign about closures or changed hours. This virus is infecting the lives of individuals and cultures alike.
